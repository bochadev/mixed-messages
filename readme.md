# Build a random message generator program

## Plan

I will create a project directory Mixed Messages and I will use git to initialize the version control.

After that, I will create a single web page that allows the user to generate random messages. To do this
I will program a message generator library, an index page that links to a main javascript file that contains the logic for capturing the message type and a button for processing it.

I will use chatGTP to generate 10 messages of each type.

## Requirements

- The program allows the user to generate random messages from three different types of messages
  - Astrological messages
  - Inspirational messages
  - Joke messages
- Each time the user runs the program, it must generate a new random message.
- User can select the message type that the program will generate
